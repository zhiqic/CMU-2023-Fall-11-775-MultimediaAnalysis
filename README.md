### 1. **Course Website Construction**
I could not find the previous course website online, so we'll need to build a new one. I am willing to be responsible for this task.

### 2. **Class Structure**
For each lecture, the website should include:
   - **Slides:** Visual aids for students to follow during the lecture.
   - **Post-Lecture Reading Material:** Resources for students to review and study after the lecture.

### 3. **Teaching Assistant (TA) Involvement**
TAs will need to be involved in various aspects of the course to assist with students' learning needs.

### 4. **Project Preparation**
Before each project, a special lecture might be needed to introduce:
   - **Development Tools:** Introducing the software and tools required for the project.
   - **Related Knowledge:** Overview of the necessary background knowledge.
This section should be completed by the main instructor.

### 5. **Guest Lectures**
At the end of the course, we can invite colleagues from the industrial or academic to discuss the latest advancements in the multimedia direction.

### 6. **My Responsibilities**
I will handle:
   - Building the course website.
   - Editing slides.
   - Preparing post-lecture reading material.
   - Drafting lectures.
