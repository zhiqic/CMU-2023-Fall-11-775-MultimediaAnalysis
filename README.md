### 1. **Course Website Construction**
I could not find the previous course website online, so we'll need to build a new one. I am willing to be responsible for this task.

### 2. **Class Structure**
For each lecture, the website should include:
   - **Slides:** Visual aids for students to follow during the lecture.
   - **Post-Lecture Reading Material:** Resources for students to review and study after the lecture.

### 3. **Teaching Assistant (TA) Involvement**
TAs will need to be involved in various aspects of the course to assist with students' learning needs.

### 4. **Project Preparation**
Before each project, a special lecture might be needed to introduce:
   - **Development Tools:** Introducing the software and tools required for the project.
   - **Related Knowledge:** Overview of the necessary background knowledge.
This section should be completed by the main instructor.

### 5. **Guest Lectures**
We can invite colleagues from the industrial or academic sectors to discuss the latest advancements in the multimedia direction.

### 6. **My Responsibilities**
I will handle:
   - Building the course website.
   - Editing slides.
   - Preparing post-lecture reading material.
   - Drafting lectures.

### 7. **Slide Modification Suggestions**

   - **09-21-2022: Image Processing:** Refine existing slides and add some of the latest content.
   - **09-26-2022: Video Processing:** Slide appears blurry; the methodology section needs reorganization. Invite Microsoftâ€™s video analysis team for a guest lecture.
   - **09-28-2022: Concept Embedding + QA1:** Include the latest research progresses in vision-language pretraining.
   - **10-03-2022: Fusion:** Expand the section on industrial applications of multimodal systems. Consider inviting colleagues from Alibaba or Microsoft for a guest lecture.
   - **10-03-2022: Scalability:** Update with modern parallel distributed processing content, possibly using KAIROS as an example and inviting industry professionals to speak.
   - **11-02-2022: Multimodal Self-Supervised Learning from Po-yao:** Consider whether to continue inviting for the lecture.
   - **2021 Vision + Language by Lu Jiang:** Consider whether to continue inviting for the lecture.

### General Considerations

1. **Course Structure:** Consider dividing the course into two modules: lectures and projects.

2. **Projects and Homework:** Alongside a final major project, consider incorporating 1-2 homework assignments to reinforce learning. Take inspiration from CS224N for more guidance to students. [CS224N Reference](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/slides/cs224n-2023-lecture07-final-project.pdf)

3. **Guest Lectures:** Consider inviting industry professionals from companies like Alibaba and Microsoft to provide insights on various topics.

4. **Focus on Cutting-edge Technologies:** Emphasize the latest research and developments, including machine vision, sensor fusion, real-time decision-making, vision-language pretraining, and more.
